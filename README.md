# MyRNotes
This is a collection of R notes and example R markdown files.

This is my first repository on GitHub.  Here I am placing a collection of Rmarkdown files 
that are examples of different tasks in R.  My goal is to create a book or a blog at some
point in time to highlight my skills or to help other become more productive using R.
